##🏥 Safe Road – AI-Based Emergency & Traffic Management System

Safe Road is an AI-powered multi-agency emergency response system designed to reduce ambulance delays, improve accident response, and enhance public safety.
The system integrates Ambulance, Hospital, Police, Fire Brigade, and Public User modules into one unified platform.

##🚀 Project Overview

Every second counts in emergencies.
Safe Road uses AI traffic monitoring, real-time alerts, video-based SOS detection, and smart routing to create a faster, safer emergency response ecosystem.

This project includes:

AI-assisted ambulance priority routing

Automatic accident detection & alert broadcasting

Public SOS system with location + front & rear video evidence

Hospital alerting with patient details

Navigation to nearest hospitals with live updates

Multi-agency emergency dashboard (Ambulance, Hospital, Police, Fire)

## Key Features :
🚑 Ambulance Module

View alerts sent by hospitals or police.

Send patient details (name, age, condition) directly to the destination hospital.

Navigate to nearest hospital using Google Maps.

The AI traffic system provides signal priority and real-time route monitoring.

Helps hospitals prepare before the ambulance arrives.

🏥 Hospital Module

Receive emergency alerts from ambulances.

View patient info in advance.

Monitor live SOS alerts from the public.

Enable hospitals to prepare required resources.

👮 Police Module

Receive Public SOS Alerts.

Alerts include:

User’s live location

Front camera video

Rear camera video

Helps police verify authenticity and respond faster.

🔥 Fire Brigade Module

Receives accident alerts and SOS notifications.

Supports quick deployment during fire or accident scenarios.

🙋‍♂️ Public User Module
